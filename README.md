## 👋 Hi there, I'm Rohit Bhagat

I'm a full-stack software engineer with 1.5+ years of experience building scalable, cross-platform applications across mobile, web, and backend systems. I specialize in crafting clean, maintainable architectures and delivering user-focused solutions with strong performance and design consistency.

I’ve independently led end-to-end development and deployment for production-grade applications — from UI design and system integration to publishing across Play Store, App Store, Windows Store, and Web. Passionate about continuous learning, product thinking, and engineering for scale, I enjoy solving real-world problems through thoughtful, reliable code.
